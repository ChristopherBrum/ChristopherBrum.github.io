# Hello, I'm Christopher and I'm a Software Engineer

Welcome to my [portfolio website](https://cbrum.dev/)! I'm a full-stack software engineer with a passion for building innovative solutions using a variety of programming languages and technologies. Here's a glimpse into my journey and some of the projects I've worked on.

## About Me

I've dedicated years to honing my skills in programming, exploring languages such as Ruby, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Go. I've also gained valuable experience with different data stores, including PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB, and Redis. My proficiency extends to frameworks and libraries like Rails, Sinatra, and React. Additionally, I'm proficient in cloud and containerization technologies like AWS, Digital Ocean, and Docker.

## Twine - Real-time WebSocket Infrastructure

One of my recent achievements is co-creating Twine, a powerful WebSocket infrastructure. Twine leverages the capabilities of 8 pre-configured AWS services, providing a robust and scalable solution. Each Twine service is deployed directly onto an AWS user account, granting complete control over infrastructure and data. Twine ensures data integrity with built-in connection state recovery, preventing data loss due to dropped WebSocket connections. It seamlessly integrates with existing web applications through client and server libraries.

## Open-Source Projects

I have a passion for contributing to the open-source community. Here are some of my notable projects:

### Request Inspect

[Request Inspect](https://github.com/LeeyaD/request_inspect) is a web tool designed for observing and testing Webhooks and HTTP requests. It's built using a tech stack that includes React, NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB. The application is deployed on a Digital Ocean droplet with an NGINX reverse-proxy for efficient performance.

### VoteVault

**VoteVault** is a web application that facilitates the upload, sorting, and searching of registered voter data. This project was crafted using Ruby, Rails, and PostgreSQL, demonstrating my expertise in building efficient and user-friendly web applications.
